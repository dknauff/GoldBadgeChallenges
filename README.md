# GoldBadgeChallenges - Console Applications

As a student in the Eleven Fifty Academy, this was the large project that wrapped up the first four weeks of the program (Gold Badge).  We were tasked to complete three console application that met the specification of fictional businesses.  The first challenge was to create a console application to manage the menu items at a cafe called Komodo Cafe.  The second challenge was to create a console application for the claims department of Komodo to manage insurance claims.  The third challenge was to create a security console application for a company called Komodo that managed security badges and their door access.  These were all built within the same solution and will open up in Visual Studio if you download the .zip and open the "GoldBadgeChallenges.sln" in the "GoldBadgeChallenges-main" folder.
